# Research Notes

## Project Overview

The Gurbani Guide aims to create an AI-powered spiritual guidance system that provides authentic, source-based responses to spiritual questions using Sikh teachings and principles.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **AI Processing**: OpenAI API for natural language understanding and response generation
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search using embeddings for relevant content discovery
- **Database**: Supabase for storing verses, katha, and historical content
- **Interface**: WhatsApp integration for accessible user interaction
- **Backend**: Node.js API with Express framework

### Data Pipeline
1. **Collection**: Gather authentic sources (Sri Guru Granth Sahib, verified katha, historical accounts)
2. **Processing**: Clean, structure, and validate content
3. **Embedding**: Generate vector embeddings for semantic search
4. **Storage**: Store in Supabase with proper indexing
5. **Retrieval**: Use semantic search to find relevant content
6. **Generation**: AI generates contextual responses with citations

## Content Sources

### Primary Sources
- **Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji**: Complete text with translations
- **Historical Sakhis**: Verified stories from Guru lives
- **Scholarly Katha**: Audio/video transcripts from recognized scholars

### Katha Scholars Identified
- Pinderpal Singh (DadrianWale)
- Sarabjit Singh Dhunda
- Thakur Singh (Patialvi)
- Sant Singh Maskeen
- Guriqbal Singh

### Data Quality Challenges
- Ensuring accuracy of Gurmukhi transcription
- Verifying authenticity of historical accounts
- Consistent translation quality
- Proper attribution and citation
- Handling different interpretation perspectives

## Technical Challenges

### Language Processing
- **Gurmukhi Script**: Proper Unicode handling and display
- **Transliteration**: Accurate Roman script conversion
- **Translation**: Maintaining meaning across languages
- **Context**: Understanding spiritual context vs literal meaning

### Search Accuracy
- **Semantic Understanding**: Capturing spiritual concepts in embeddings
- **Cultural Context**: Ensuring AI understands Sikh cultural context
- **Intent Recognition**: Distinguishing between different types of spiritual questions
- **Relevance Ranking**: Prioritizing most appropriate sources

### Scalability Considerations
- **Database Performance**: Efficient vector search at scale
- **API Rate Limits**: Managing OpenAI API usage
- **WhatsApp Limitations**: Handling message volume and rate limits
- **Content Updates**: Efficient updates to embedding database

## AI Model Considerations

### Model Selection
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: For high-quality response generation
- **Text-Embedding-3-Small**: For efficient semantic search
- **Future Considerations**: Fine-tuning on spiritual content

### Prompt Engineering
- **System Prompts**: Establishing spiritual guidance context
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Providing examples of appropriate responses
- **Source Integration**: Teaching model to cite and reference properly
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Ensuring respectful and appropriate tone

### Response Quality
- **Authenticity**: Never generating fake verses or quotes
- **Citation**: Always providing source references
- **Humility**: Maintaining appropriate spiritual tone
- **Practicality**: Offering actionable guidance

## User Experience Research

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Practicing Sikhs seeking spiritual guidance
- **Secondary**: Non-Sikhs interested in Sikh philosophy
- **Tertiary**: Researchers and students of comparative religion

### Interface Preferences
- **WhatsApp**: Familiar, accessible platform
- **Voice Support**: Future consideration for audio responses
- **Multilingual**: Support for Punjabi, Hindi, English
- **Offline Access**: Cached responses for common questions

### Content Preferences
- **Brevity**: Concise responses with depth available on request
- **Citations**: Clear source attribution
- **Context**: Historical and cultural background when helpful
- **Personalization**: Responses adapted to user's spiritual level
